            <h1>Life's Journey</h1>
        <p>Humans can never fully grasp the mystery called life. Every waking day the question begs to be answered, "What is my purpose on earth?". Life is an uncertainty, a multilayered object that unravels something new when one skin is pulled out. We find out that there's a lot  to know and learn from life itself. Since ancient times, umans have tried to fathom how and why life began. Are we getting any closer to solving the riddle?</p>

        <p>Let us begin with the familiar view that life has a meaning only insofar as we make it meaningful in the way that we live. This is to focus on the value of each individual life, in which respect it may be contrasted with human destiny as being part of a greater scheme of things, as when we look to religion to give significance to our lives beyond our earthly pursuits.</p>

            <h2>THE MYSTERIOUS MEANING OF LIFE</h2>
            <h4>BY HENRY HARBERS</h4>

            <P>THERE is no one, except hei is one that cannot think at all, who does not at times wonder what life means, why it ends in death, what comes after, and why it is all a mystery.</P>
            <p>Yet while man has thought and wondered about these for thousand of years, the strange fact is that what really seems to be the most important truth about life, the very facts of life that will lead to the clearest answer to the questions of life's meaning and destiny, are truths that have ever been overlooked, unrecognised and ignored.</p>
            <p>These truths or facts of life have been neglected and their meaning allowed to pass unrecognised, no doubt because life is held to be essentially a mystery, the solution of which is not to be found in life and the whole world, but beyond this life and the world.</p>
            <p>Things or facts that indicate the meaning of life and explain the conditions of our existence, are the fact that life is gamelike in character, and the further fact that life is dramatic also in its character. Life and the world is at once both a drama and a game. Everything in and about the world contributes to make life and the world's story a drama and a game. The non-recognision of these facts is shown in that the world's drama and the game of life are recognised only as incidental matters and not as the essential features. They are not seen as being the very things that the world exists for, and that life here is meant to be.</p>

            <h1>THE OPEN COURT</h1>
            <P>It is in this possession at once of dramatic and gamelike characteristics, that the real meaning of life and the purpose of the world must be sought for.</P>
            <p>The secret appears to be simply this; your life in all that you do in showing your ambitions, your characteristics, your passions, with all the results that follow in the different situations in life that you find yourself in. Situations that are comic, tragic, and romantic, and which if portrayed upon the stage would be called dramatic, is really and trully dramatic.</p>
            <p>The mystery of life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced. As Fyodor Dostoyevsky aptly puts it, "The mystery of human existence lies not just in staying alive, but in finding something to live for.</p>
            <p>You are called to stand up for life! To respect and defend the mystery of life always and everywhere, including the lives of unborn babies, giving real help and encouragement to mothers in difficult situations. Pope John Paul II.</p>
